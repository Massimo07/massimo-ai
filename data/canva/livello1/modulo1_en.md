1. **Sign Up and Explore:**
   - Open your web browser and go to [www.canva.com](http://www.canva.com).
   - Click on the "Sign Up" button. You can register using your email, Google account, or Facebook account.
   - Once you're signed up, take a moment to explore the Canva dashboard. Familiarize yourself with the layout, including the toolbar on the left, which provides access to templates, elements, uploads, text, and more.

2. **Choosing a Template:**
   - For network marketing, let’s start by designing a social media post. Click on "Templates" in the left toolbar.
   - Use the search bar to find "Social Media Post" templates. Choose a template that suits your brand’s aesthetic. For instance, if you're promoting a new product for Live On Plus, find a vibrant, attention-grabbing template.

3. **Customizing Your Design:**
   - Click on the text in the template to edit it. Replace it with your message, such as "Join Live On Plus Today for Exclusive Benefits!"
